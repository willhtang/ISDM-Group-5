###  Relationship Manager
RM are responsible for handling the interaction with the customers. They ensure the profits by selling the holiday packages provided the company to customer via telephone call. The implementation of the new system will allow for adjustment of the call flow rate to suitable RM and thus be able to serve their end-customers (or potential customer).

#### Who are we empathising with?
+ We are empathising with the Relational Managers (RM) who are responsible to perform the sales of holiday packages provided by the travel company. 
#### What do they need to do?
+ RM needs to have the product knowledge in order to improve call flow rate.
+ Have Good communication skills.
+ Provide potential-customers consultation.
#### What do they see?
+ Improved call flow rate.
+ Ability to adapt to new customers.
#### What do they say?
+ The RM will say work has been a lot easier now.
#### What do they do?
+ Have problems understanding the customers' needs.
+ Provide bad customer service skills due to lack of knowledge on the packages.
#### What do they hear?
+ Anger language from the customers.

+ Not be able to make product (holiday package) sales.
#### Gains?
+ Increase in product sales.
+ RMs work satisfaction since customers are satisfied.
+ Improvement in overall customer service skills. 


###  Travel Company Director

#### Who are we empathising with?
+ We are empathising with the director of a major travel company whom has requested for the development of the new system.
+ Currently the director has not seen an improvement in business operations and product sales.
+ The role of the director is to invest in the travel company to boost the effectiveness and productivity of business operations.
#### What do they need to do?
+ The director needs to decide how much he is willing to spend on the new system, as well as when he needs the system to be implemented.
#### What do they see?
+ The director currently sees a consistent output from the 'Call Management Centre' but also sees no changes in company profit margins.
#### What do they say?
+ The director will probably say to himself that he needs a way to boost the company's profit.
#### What do they do?
+ The director is business driven and will make decisions that will benefit the company money-wise over both short and long term periods.
#### What do they hear?
+ The director might be hearing negative reviews and feedback, such as poor quality customer services and long call wait times.
#### Pains?
+ The director is probably concerned whether the new system is worth its cost and will boost the efficiency and productivity of the call centre.
#### Gains?
+ The director would be hoping to increase the company's profit margin from increased sales as a result of the implementation of the new system.


###  Technical Support Worker

#### Who are we empathising with?
+ We are empathising with the technical support workers who maintain the system used by Relationship Managers.
#### What do they need to do?
+ When a new system is implemented, tech support workers need to be re-trained on the equipment/system functions in the new version of the system.
#### What do they see?
+ The tech support workers will see the behaviours of the server graphically over time to determine how the system is affected by usage.
#### What do they say?
+ Tech support workers will inform upper management of technical incidents that have arised, how they have been resolved, and what further actions are required.
#### What do they do?
+ Ensure system servers are operational during work hours.
#### What do they hear?
+ Tech support workers are hearing complaints from relationship managers about the reliability of the system consistently remaining functional during work hours without lag.
#### Pains?
+ Tech support workers will have concerns regarding the maintainability of the new system, difficulty of resolving technical issues.
+ They will be concerned of potential new unresolvable bugs in the new system.
#### Gains?
+ An improved functioning system will significantly relieve work load on tech support workers.


### Interactive Voice Response

### Profiler Tool

### Automatic Call Distributor

## Point Of View (POV) Statements:
### Relationship Manager (RM):
+ RMs needs to have meaningful conversations with the potential customers because that will increase the sales of holiday packages. 
+ High Profiled RMs needs the system to match them to customers with high scores because their profile demands potential customers.
+ RMs needs clear knowledge of the holiday packages because customers need to be able to understand the holiday package. 

## How Might We (HMW) Statements:
### Relationship Manager (RM):
+ How Might We teach RMs to have meaningful conversations?
+ How Might We encourage RMs to undertake friendly conversation?
+ How Might We make the system that allows us to facilitate customer and RMs connection?
+ How Might We make recognizable potential customers to match RMs?
+ How Might We encourage RMs to get more knowledge on the holiday package?
+ How Might We provide customers sufficient knowledge using RM?s

## Reflections:
An analysis of the system requirements has led us to make few assumptions on the existing system and the new system. The tools that will be used in the new system such as Profiler Tool, Interactive Voice Response and Automatic Call Distributor are assumed to be compatible with the new system. The brainstorm concluded that the old system was inefficient and was causing a negative impact on the business total sales and therefore implementation of the new system is required. The following assumptions were considered:

+ Data storage system capacity is sufficient for the implementation of the new system. 
+ Profiler Tool is capable of creating profiles with high volume usage of customers.
+ The old system consisted of manual data manipulation and was inconsistent, thereby resulting in heavy loss for the travel company.
+ The proposed system is well within the range of budget and will not result in negative cash flow.
+ The Call Management Centre will have backup telephone providers if outages were to happen.
+ RM are able to accept whether the score is suitable for the certain customers. 
+ The score of the customer can be impacted by their lack of interest in the packages.
+ Current system has led Travel company to be dominated by other competitors due to lack of sales it produced. 

## Use Case Diagram:
#### User story:
+ Relationship Manager

As the RM, I want to be matched with customers comparable to my product knowledge so that I can offer the service they deserve.

As the RM, I want to decide whether the score is suitable for the customer after the call session so that I can make sure the customer is receiving the required information about the holiday packages.

As the RM, I want to be able to answer the 10 minutes questionnaire so that I can have a good profile to attain potential customers.

As the RM, I want to be skillful in communication so that I can increase my profile and over all skills.
