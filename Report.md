## Executive Summary

This report details the new information system developed for a major travel company and its call management centre (CMC) in particular. 
The report begins in introducing its objectives and definition of the problem to be solved. This stage of the project is crucial as it is through the clear definition of the objectives and the problem, that gives the team clear direction and structure as to what needs to be addressed in the project.

Moreover, it goes through the approach made through Design Thinking principles. Design Thinking allows us to keep an end-user centred focus to all the decisions and assumptions made in the project. Furthermore, through the identification of stakeholders, we were able to determine their user stories, point of view statements and how might we statements to better understand assist them in the new information system developed. 

Additionally, the report details the work products and models that were created to visualize and document how the new system is to function. These included a use case diagram, activity diagram, class diagram and collaboration diagram. Additionally, the report also identifies the advantages of the new system, such as increased efficiency in their day to day operations leading to increased revenue and overall profit as well as potential consequences if the new system fails to meet it’s criteria such as loss of revenue, customer base and decreased competitiveness as a business.


## Objectives of the Project:

The primary objective of the project is to help improve the call management centre of the travel company who commissioned the project. As this is a crucial component of the business, it is vital to carefully consider what changes need to occur and the potential benefits and/or ramifications of implementing them. The business has explicitly noted that the new system will need to be able to improve the relationship manager customer matching process through the adjustment of the call flow rate whereby the relationship manager most suited to that particular customer is selected. Overall, through the completion of these objectives, the company will be able to generate more sales leading to greater profit and a wider customer base. 

## Definition of the problem:

+ Lack of effective Relationship Managers can lead to ineffective communication with potential customers resulting in a reduction in travel packages sold, ultimately impacting the company’s bottom line.

+ Potential customers can be put off from buying a travel package due to long wait times during busy periods.

+ Prioritising repeated customers and customers more likely to purchase can over time detract from customer base as potential repeat customers are not matched to highly rated Relationship Managers.


## Design Thinking

Design thinking is based upon nurturing customer-centric product innovation. This essentially means, that the design process actively thinks and focuses about the end users and customers when planning and building the project and how best to satisfy their needs. 

The first stage starts of this process as we empathise with our end users and customers. This stage helped us understand the beliefs and feelings of those we are designing for. We carried out making empathy maps for all our stakeholders in order to elicit what their real needs are. In the second stage we identified and defined the problems we had to solve, the empathy maps that were already present helped us to further pinpoint what our information system had to solve. Then during the ideate stage we brainstormed potential solutions and noted down whether they were feasible to do. In the prototype stage we went through a few iterations of what we wanted to achieve, but due to the lack of time we weren’t able to complete many prototypes. Finally we went into the testing stage and implemented our chosen design.


##  Stakeholders:

## Agile Development
The agile process, in regards to software development, is a management methodology that centres around the principle of dividing a project into several subtasks and attempt to complete them in interative cycles (sprints) of elicitation, execution and evaluation. Due to the nature of being separated into smaller parts, the project can continuously evolve based on new client requirements, re-evaluations and the requirements of other stakeholders collaborating on the project.

For this project, we have used the Scrum agile framework to manage the development of a new information system for improved operation in the 'Call Management Centre' of a major travel company. In accordance to the Scrum framework, we ordered the subtasks of developing the system's functionalities by priority, from the point of view of the client, into a product backlog.

At the beginning of each sprint, we used the product backlog as a reference point to plan a progress target for completing system functionalities in that sprint. The progress during a short sprint, of a week, is reported to other members of the project team daily in a stand-up Scrum meeting of less than 15 minutes. The daily Scrum meetings encourage team members to talk about what they have completed, what they are planning on completing and obstacles they have faced in the completion of their tasks. This process allows all team members to understand the current situation and also allows the Scrum Master to better manage the work flow in the development of the information system.

At the end of each sprint, we would conduct a sprint review. The sprint review is a meeting which takes place between the Scrum team and other stakeholders of this project. The functions completed during the sprint are presented to the other stakeholders and are reviewed for adaptations. In addition to the sprint review, a sprint retrospective is also conducted. In contrast to the sprint review, the sprint retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum development team to discuss with the Scrum Master potential ways to improve technical practices in the development process.

## Point Of View (POV) Statements:

### Customer
+ Customers need to be matched with suitable Relationship Managers to be able to have a good experience when purchasing their holiday package.
+ Customers need to have an idea in mind of what they would like when calling for a holiday package so that the Relationship Manager can better inform and help them choose a holiday package.
+ Customers need to be informed about how to handle potential contingencies such as cancellation of the holiday or what to do should they face issues while on their holiday.
+ Customers during busy periods should be informed that they are in a queue so that they can decide whether they want to continue in the queue or call back at a later time.

### Relationship Manager (RM)
+ RMs needs to have meaningful conversations with the potential customers because that will increase the sales of holiday packages. 
+ High Profiled RMs needs the system to match them to customers with high scores because their profile demands potential customers.
+ RMs needs clear knowledge of the holiday packages because customers need to be able to understand the holiday package.

### Travel Company Director
+ The travel company director needs the system to be inexpensive because the system is an investment to improve current company profit margins.
+ The director needs the new system to be more efficient than the old one because the system was requested to quantitatively improve the company's sales.

### Tech Support Worker
+ Tech support workers needs the new system to be directly implementable over the old system because it will be easier to maintain.
+ Tech support workers need the system to be quality assured because they will not be able to resolve unexpected errors in system functionality easily.

## How Might We (HMW) Statements:

### Customers 
+ How might we speed up the time the customer spends with relationship managers?
+ How might we make our holiday packages more appealing to customers?
+ How might we better communicate with customers?
+ How might we make the process easier for customers?
+ How might we make customers repeated customers?

### Relationship Manager (RM)

+ How might we make the system so that it can be directly implemented over the old system without new equipment?

## Reflections:
An analysis of the system requirements has led us to make few assumptions on the existing system and the new system. The tools that will be used in the new system such as Profiler Tool, Interactive Voice Response and Automatic Call Distributor are assumed to be compatible with the new system. The brainstorm concluded that the old system was inefficient and was causing a negative impact on the business total sales and therefore implementation of the new system is required. The following assumptions were considered:

+ Data storage system capacity is sufficient for the implementation of the new system. 
+ Profiler Tool is capable of creating profiles with high volume usage of customers.
+ The old system consisted of manual data manipulation and was inconsistent, thereby resulting in heavy loss for the travel company.
+ The proposed system is well within the range of budget and will not result in negative cash flow.
+ The Call Management Centre will have backup telephone providers if outages were to happen.
+ RM are able to accept whether the score is suitable for the certain customers. 
+ The score of the customer can be impacted by their lack of interest in the packages.
+ Current system has led Travel company to be dominated by other competitors due to lack of sales it produced.

## Competitive Advantages And Possible Effects If The Project Fails:
Competitive advantage is circumstances where the company is put in a favourable position than its competitors involved. New system is developed for the Travel Company to reach its sales goals. The implementation of the new system will ensure an efficient process in the call route system for the call management centre. The new system will match customers with RMs based on their profiles and score. The previous system or the current system has led Travel Company to be dominated by other competitors due to inefficiency in the process of data manipulation and matchmaking. With the implementation of the proposed system, the Travel Company will prospect for profit. The matchmaking system  with assistance from Profiler Tool will guarantee an increase in customer satisfaction as the RMs are able to provide the maximum support and information required for the customers. The new system includes a score system which will increase customers' interest in the company. Customers would want to increase their scores by reducing the call duration in phone calls in order to be served with priorities as high score served first rules apply and with private automatic branch exchange to route calls will decrease the customer’s per-call handling time by a comparable amount and therefore being a cost effective technique . 

Competitive advantage is a huge factor in constraining the profits and should be placed at top priority by the company.  As such, with the new system implemented, the efficiency in the CMT operation process will elevate Travelling Company’s position in the market and increase in demand. Tools such as The Interactive Voice Response Tool and Automatic Call Distributor are also included in the system to reduce customer waiting time and promote customer satisfaction in the overall service. By maximising the customer satisfaction, the Travel Company is ultimately attaining a competitive advantage over their competitors and the advantage is maintained for a period of time, the business will reach greater height than its competitors in the same field. 

If  the system were to fail that will result in complete failure in the call routing and will result in customer dissatisfaction. A system failure occurs if the system does not meet the requirement or when the usage of the system leads to malfunction. It may even occur due to power outage or if the system cannot handle the data transaction.  In order to combat this, multiple solutions must be implemented along with the proposed system. First solution that can be used in the implementation phase is the usage of the implementation methods.  For example, using parallel implementation to ensure that the new system is functioning as intended and no memory leakage is found for first few weeks and then direct change to the new system. Second solution is backing up the data in the information system so even if the system were to fail, it can be recovered and functional. Another solution might be continuous update to the information system to handle high volume of new customers and the existing customers.  By having these planned solutions, the system can be protected and will maintain a sustainable reputation in the competitive field.
