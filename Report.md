##  Travel Company Director
### Who are we empathising with?
+ We are empathising with the director of a major travel company whom has requested for the development of the new system.
+ Currently the director has not seen an improvement in business operations and product sales.
+ The role of the director is to invest in the travel company to boost the effectiveness and productivity of business operations.
### What do they need to do?
+ The director needs to decide how much he is willing to spend on the new system, as well as when he needs the system to be implemented.
### What do they see?
+ The director currently sees a consistent output from the 'Call Management Centre' but also sees no changes in company profit margins.
### What do they say?
+ The director will probably say to himself that he needs a way to boost the company's profit.
### What do they do?
+ The director is business driven and will make decisions that will benefit the company money-wise over both short and long term periods.
### What do they hear?
+ The director might be hearing negative reviews and feedback, such as poor quality customer services and long call wait times.
### Pains?
+ The director is probably concerned whether the new system is worth its cost and will boost the efficiency and productivity of the call centre.
### Gains?
+ The director would be hoping to increase the company's profit margin from increased sales as a result of the implementation of the new system.
